# Animal Tracker

Animal Tracker is designed to study migration activity, eating habits, and daily routines of different species. Once the user signs up they are able to fill out the track form which requires: date, time, species, activity, and location. The precise latitude and longitude can be easily added using a dropped pin on the Google Map. After tracks are added they appear on their map as well as on their track list to allow easy access and comparison. Tracks can be edited or deleted and account passwords can be reset by email or changed if needed. Animal Tracker is designed for biologists, zoologists, or animal enthusiats alike but can also be used by anyone who owns a pet and wants to monitor their behavior. Sometimes small activity changes in any animal can be a subtle sign to an even bigger problem to come.
